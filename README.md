## Rich Markdown Editor for Standard Notes

![Sample editor](./images/screenshot.png)

This is an attempt to use Outline's editor into Standard Notes.

Outline uses an awesome Markdown editor, [Rich Markdown Editor](https://github.com/outline/rich-markdown-editor) that fits great with Standard Notes. It is very close to what Bear does on Mac.

This is my first React application, so probably there are a lot of improvements. Feel free to make recommendations and/or open issues.
